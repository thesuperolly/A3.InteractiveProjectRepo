### 7/4/21 - Project begins.

Today production begaan on the final project for Data Informed UX. I gave my brief presentation of what I was planing on building and then covered over a few of the reasons i thought it would be a good project. I than began by setting up my repo and connected it to Github so that my progress could be easily tracked.  
I am reasonably confident that I can get the app looking the way I want pretty quickly, but I am concerned that I will have a hard time creating the back end functionality.  
To address this i plan on creating a very basic front-end that can then create a flowchart of what I need to create with the back end code and API requests. I hoe to use the suggestions made by Ben, that will allow me to store an API request locally so that I can develop the back end without hitting my API call limits. Wee will see how it goes though.
